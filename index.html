      Con-trust is my entry for
      <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/07/01/mini-ld-36-contrasts/"
         >Mini-LD #36: Contrasts</a>.
      It&rsquo;s built
      with <a href="http://entityjs.com/">EntityJS</a> using sprites I
      made in <a href="http://aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>. The source
      is on GitHub
      at <a href="https://github.com/smcgivern/con-trust"
            >smcgivern/con-trust</a>,
      with the built version, along with source for this page, at
      <a href="https://github.com/smcgivern/con-trust-built"
         >smcgivern/con-trust-built</a>.

      To play: click to move. You can&rsquo;t move on to mountains,
      just flat tiles. Different coloured flat tiles move you between
      levels. There&rsquo;s an
      <abbr title="Non-player character">NPC</abbr> on each
      level. When you talk to them, they&rsquo;ll tell you their
      story. You can then either decide that they are trying to con
      you, and so con them back, or to trust them and believe that
      they will do what they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more honest an NPC is, the less likely they are to cheat
      you. And the savvier they are, the more likely they are to spot
      your attempt to con them. The idea is to make as much money as
      possible by the end of the game.

      (Yes, I got carried away with the pun rather than thinking about
      the game mechanics.)
